# Curve-Fitting-Toyon

In this project, we collected Fv_Fm measurements at different temperatures from different Toyon plants to compare heat tolerance under different environmental conditions (Irrigation Levels, Light Levels). These scripts visualize the data, fit curves, and perform statistical analyses.
